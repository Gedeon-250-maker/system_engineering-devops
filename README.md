# system_engineering-devops

This repository contains solutions for the "Shellâ€”The Basics" project, which is part of my system engineering and DevOps curriculum.

Through these tasks, I am gaining hands-on experience with fundamental Linux shell commands, including:
* Navigating the file system (e.g., finding the current directory, changing directories).
* Listing file and directory contents in various formats.
* Working with hidden files.

Each task is implemented as a shell script in the `0x00-shell_basics` directory.
